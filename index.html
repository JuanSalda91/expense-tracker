  <!-- Hello Team, Please see added notes for review:
       This is just the HTML skeleton / structure for the SpendingChart component.
       The real logic (filtering transactions, building the data, drawing the pie chart)
       happens in TypeScript/JavaScript with Recharts, NOT in this file.- By TN

       Hi this should  help with the OUTER CARD WRAPPER
       Matches: <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">
       Purpose: A card box around the whole “Spending by Category” section. By TN

         TITLE / HEADER

    <!-- =====================================================
         OK SO THE CHART AREA WRAPPER (WHEN THERE *IS* DATA)
         Here: it’s just a placeholder box where the pie chart would be drawn.
         Note: In the real app, Recharts will create an <svg> inside here.
    ====================================================== -->
    <div class="chart-area" style="width: 100%; height: 300px;">

      <!-- =================================================
           OK SO THE TOOLTIP PLACEHOLDER
           Purpose: Shows the category + amount when user hovers.
           Here: we just mark a spot where JS can hook in a tooltip.By TN
      ================================================== -->
      <div class="chart-tooltip-placeholder">

      <!-- =================================================
           ANOTHER PLACEHOLDER
           Purpose: Shows which color belongs to which category.

    <!-- =====================================================
         EMPTY STATE (WHEN THERE IS *NO* EXPENSE DATA)
         Purpose: Friendly message when there are no expenses.
         HEY GUYS NOTE: In a real app, you only show EITHER the chart OR this box,
               not both at the same time.
    ====================================================== -->
    <div class="empty-state h-64 flex items-center justify-center">
      <p class="text-gray-500">
        No expenses to display
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- I Believe this part is were you would:
         - Calculate expensesByCategory from transactions
         - If no data → show the .empty-state and hide the .chart-area
         - If there is data → show the .chart-area and hide the .empty-state
         That logic is not in HTML. HTML only gives us the boxes.
